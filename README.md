Premalignant lesions of intestinal-type gastric cancer (GC), including intestinal metaplasia (IM) and low-grade dysplasia (LGD), require in-depth molecular characterization to better stratify their progression risk and refine their management strategy. Here, we constructed a large-scale single-cell multiomics profile of 1,122,027 cells from intact premalignant and malignant gastric lesions. We explored diverse cell types/states within the premalignant epithelium and identified a concurrent aggressive cell state that resembled GC-related expression programs, including features related to cancer-related partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We named it as the exceedingly-early GC (EEGC) state and systematically uncovered underlying gene regulatory elements by analysing the paired scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data. Moreover, we delineated EEGC-associated spatial organization and clonal architecture by performing spatial transcriptomic analysis and found that the EEGC state could spatially mark high-risk LGD foci. Additionally, we found that the EEGC state was associated with a tumour-promoting milieu characterized by the expansion of SULF1-expressing fibroblasts and immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. Finally, the EEGC state could be used to clinically distinguish high-risk LGD patients who could progress to GC from ‘indolent’ patients, which was validated in 327 LGD patients from independent retrospective longitudinal cohorts. Collectively, our study provides innovative strategies for gastric malignant risk stratification and early cancer intervention.
